Rewrite in progress. I think I learned enough about the technologies I wanted to explore with this. Now I want to do it the right way and learn something new along the lines. I already use the native audio-driver since it just works better then trying to fiddle around with the ``<audio>`` element, I will be doing it as a native application via [fyne](https://fyne.io/).


# PLD Alarm

A Clock application that is designed to run on a raspberry PI. And later on integrate with Home-Assistant or some homebrewn protocol.

Basically a replacement for an Echo Dot which I mainly use just as a clock that plays radio when I need to wake up. I feel it could do more without creepily watching me sleep.

Also a PoC to get more into GO and have a clean stack that completly removes any heavy JS-Framework and just keeps it simple, like in 'ye old tymes'. Back in the day when there was only one state and not ALL THE STATES that have to be managed. Also I want to keep it lightweight for the Raspberry, but not really give up UX.
